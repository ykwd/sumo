# We need your Help\!

Building a scenario is a lot of work. If you have built a sumo scenario
you can share (under a sufficiently open license), please
[Contact](../Contact.md) us.

# Bologna

A small-scale scenario based on the city of Bologna. The large
roundabout can be found at 44.494554,11.314393. These scenarios were
developed as part of the [iTETRIS project](http://www.ict-itetris.eu). A
[publication](http://elib.dlr.de/89354) on these scenarios was presented
at [SUMO
Conference 2014](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Publications.html#SUMO_2014): L.
Bieker, D. Krajzewicz, A. Morra, C. Michelacci and F. Cartolano,
"Traffic simulation for all: a real world traffic scenario from the city
of Bologna", SUMO2014, p 19-26

# TAPASCologne

![ssnap_TapasCologne_0.1.gif](../images/Ssnap_TapasCologne_0.1.gif
"TAPAS Cologne") The "TAPAS Cologne" simulation scenario
describes the traffic within the city of Cologne, Germany for a whole
day. The original demand data stems from TAPAS, a system which computes
mobility wishes for an area population generated based on information
about travelling habits of Germans and on information about the
infrastructure of the area they live in.

More information about the system can be found within this [publication
on TAPAS](http://elib.dlr.de/45058/02/SRL_81_-_Beitrag_Varschen.pdf).
The original data was using a closed-source road network and was mapped
onto one stemming from the [OpenStreetMap
project](http://www.openstreetmap.de/).

There is further information about
[TAPASCologne](../Data/Scenarios/TAPASCologne.md).

# Further real-world scenarios

- [Bologna Ringway](http://www.cs.unibo.it/projects/bolognaringway/).
    Scenario built within the [COLOMBO R&D
    project](http://www.colombo-fp7.eu).

!!! caution
    The scenario is known to have lots of collisions due to unsafe traffic lights and some invalid junction definitions. Furthermore it is quite jammed

# Synthetic scenarios

Synthetic - or abstract - scenarios only resemble typical layouts of
real-world junctions and arterials without mapping a very specific one.
Some synthetic scenarios of the [COLOMBO R&D
project](http://www.colombo-fp7.eu) are examples of the German guideline
RiLSA. They are described in [D1.1 "Scenario Specifications and Required
Modifications to Simulation
Tools"](http://www.colombo-fp7.eu/deliverables/COLOMBO_D1.1_ScenariosExtensions_v2.4.pdf)(chapter
4).
