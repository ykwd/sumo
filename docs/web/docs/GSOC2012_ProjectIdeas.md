# Project Ideas for Google Summer of Code 2012

!!! note
    Prerequisites for all projects: C++ coding on Linux or Windows

## Implement [left-hand traffic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-hand_traffic)

SUMO uses right-hand traffic and therefore presents obstacles when
simulating traffic in many parts of the world.

## Implement GUI-frontends for some of the command-line-only applications

The use of command-line applications presents a steep learning curve to
many users. Even a generic tool for setting options may be of great
help.

## Enhance Capabilities of the Simulation Viewer

The [sumo-gui](sumo-gui.md) application depends on configuration
files. Since editing configuration files is difficult for many users,
[sumo-gui](sumo-gui.md) should provide for a mechanism to load
the required files via menus.

## Implement a movement model for pedestrians

Right now, SUMO can account for pedestrians when simulating inter-modal
traffic. However, the model is quite coarse. The time for crossing roads
is not modelled. Also, there is no flow model for crowded side walks.

## Open for your Ideas

If you are planning to work with SUMO in your bachelor or masters
thesis, what extra feature do you need to get started?
