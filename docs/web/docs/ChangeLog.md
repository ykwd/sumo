### Bugfixes
- simulation  
  - Fixed crash when loading simulation state that includes a routeDistribution along with a route file that includes the same distribution. Issue #7539
  - Fixed automatic ride sharing for personTrips between the same origin and destination that did not declare a common 'group'. By default, rides are not shared. Automatic ride sharing for persontTrips and rides can be enabled by setting option **--persontrip.default.group STR** to an arbitrary value. Issue #7559, #7560
  - Fixed invalid active-vehicle count after loading state. Issue #7583
  - Fixed bug where leader vehicles were ignored during lane-changing when using the sublane mode. Issue #7614
  - Fixed invalid conflict check for vehicles on the same intersection. Issue #7618, #7173
  - Fixed failure to create a rescue lane. Issue #7173
  - Fixed crash on parallel intermodal routing. Issue #7627
  - Parallel intermodal routing now respects the option **--routing-algorithm**. Issue #7628
  - railway fixes
    - Fixed unwanted influence by stopped trains on insertion and rail signal operation. Issue #7527, #7529 (regression in 1.7.0)
    - Fixed train collision due to unsafe rail signal state. Issue #7534
    - Fixed unsafe train insertion. Issue #7579
    - Rail signal constraints now work correctly after loading simulation state. Issue #7523

- netconvert

  - Fixed missing right-turn connections from bicycle lanes to mixed traffic road. Issue #7548  
  - Road lanes that prohibit bicycles no longer receive bicycle permissions when a bicycle lane ends. Instead the bicycle lane receives a double-connection to allowed target edges where needed. Issue #2350
  - Fixed invalid right of way for right-turning double-connections at intersections with one incoming road. The rightmost lane now gets priority. Issue #7552
  - Fixed inconsistent OSM-typemap that artificially restricted bicycle driving direction on edge type 'highway.path'. Issue #7615
  - Fixed unsafe intersection rules for double connection with internal junction. Issue #7622
  
- netedit
  - Visual scaling of selected objects (via selection frame) is now working for junctions (regression in 1.7.0). Issue #7571
  - Crossings no longer disappear when changing lane count of crossed edges. Issue #7626
  
- sumo-gui
  - Rail carriages are now drawn next to the track when at a stop with parking=true. Issue #7528
  - Fixed invalid simulation end after reloading. Issue #7582

### Enhancements
- simulation
  - Added vehicle attribute 'departEdge' which can be used to [insert a vehicle beyond the first edge of its route](Definition_of_Vehicles,_Vehicle_Types,_and_Routes.md#departedge). Issue #1129
  - Added new input elements that can be loaded to influence rail signal operation by providing constraints on train ordering. Issue #7435

  - Added [randomTrips.py](Tools/Trip.md) option **--via-edge-types**. When this option is set to a list of types, edges of this type are not used for departure or arrival unless they are on the fringe. This can be used to prevent departure on the middle of a motorway. Issue #7505
  - Added new tool [generateRailSignalConstraints.py](Simulation/Railways.md#generaterailsignalconstraintspy) to generated constraint input for rain signals from a route file. Issue #7436
  - Added [traceExporter.py](Tools/TraceExporter.md) option **--shift** which allows shifting output coordinates by a fixed amount (i.e. to avoid negative values).
   Added [traceExporter.py](Tools/TraceExporter.md) now supports option **--ipg-output** for generating car-maker tracefiles. Issue #6190
  - [routeSampler.py](Tools/Turns.md#routesampler.py) now supports option **--minimize-vehicles FLOAT** which allows configuring a preference for fewer generated vehicles (where each vehicle passes multiple counting locations). Issue #7635

  - **summary-output** now includes number of stopped vehicles. Issue #6966
  - Option **--scale** now also applies to persons. Issue #5564
  - Emission-output is now written only for those vehicles that have an emission device. By default all vehicles get the device when option **--emission-output** is set. This default can be changed by standard device assignment options and configurations. Issue #7079
  - Added option **--device.emissions.period** to control the period in which emission-output is written. Issue #7079

- netconvert
  - Added option **--discard-param KEY1,KEY2,..** which deletes all `<param .../>` elements with the given keys. Issue #6972
  - Added option **edges.join-tram-dist {{DT_FLOAT}}** which can be used to join overlying road and tram edges into a single lane with combined permissions. This is needed for the correct dynamics in OSM-derived networks. Issue #6980
  - When loading **ptstop-files** and filtering the network extend, the loaded stops will be filtered automatically. Issue #7024
  - When specifying a polygon boundary for option **--keep-edges.in-boundary**, the argument may now contain spaces to separate positions. This allows copying a polygon shape attribute. Issue #7025

  - Added new traffic light layout 'alternateOneWay' to model work zones where each direction uses the interior of a joined traffic light exclusively. Issue #7199
  - Added option **--roundabouts.visibility-distance** to set the default visibility distance when entering a roundabout. The new default is 9 (meters) which is twice the default link visibility and this leads to smoother flow when there are no foe vehicles at a roundabout. The old behavior can be restored by setting **--roundabouts.visibility-distance -1**. Issue #4703
  
- netedit
  - Edges can now be colored by edgeData attribute (as in sumo-gui). Issue #6953

- od2trips
  - Can now specify persontrip modes with option **--persontrip.modes**. Issue #7219
  
- meso
  - Added option **--meso-tls-flow-penalty FLOAT**. This can be used to control the headway penalty to model maximum (averaged) flow at traffic lights. Formerly the option **--meso-tls-penalty** was responsible for this but now the latter option only controls the travel time penalty. Issue #7497, #7491

- All Applications
  - Symbolic color definition "random" can now be used (i.e. in vehicle, vType, poi, ...). Issue #7058
  - There is a new emission model "Zero" replacing "HBEFA*/zero" etc. Furthermore the default emission class for a model can now be chosen using something like "HBEFA3/default". Issue #7098

- TraCI

  - Added functionality for retrieving lane, position and stopped vehicles for traci domains 'busstop', 'parkingarea', 'chargingstation' and 'overheadwire'. Issue #5952, #7099
  - The python client now supports the optional argument 'traceFile' in function traci.start which records all traci commands to the given file (also works for libsumo.start). The optional boolean argument 'traceGetters' can be used to switch off tracing of data retrieval functions. Issue#6604, #7481
  - Added function 'vehicle.replaceStop' which replaces the upcoming stop with the given index and automatically adapts the route to the new stop edge. Issue #7226
  - Added function 'vehicle.getFollower' which works like getLeader but looks backwards. Issue #7107
  - Retrieval of prior person stages now includes departure time and travel time. Issue #7274
  - Added 'simulation.getVersion' to libsumo and C++ client. Issue #7282
  - Function ['person.moveToXY'](TraCI/Change_Person_State.md#move_to_xy_0xb4) is now officially supported whenever a person is walking or stopped. It can be used to move a person to an arbitrary place and will update the route accordingly. Issue #2872, #7367, #7382
  - Added function 'person.getLaneID'. Issue #7394
  - Added function 'gui.track' which can be used to track persons. Issue #7400
  - Added functions 'routeprobe.sampleLastRouteID' and 'traci.routeprobe.sampleCurrentRouteID'. Issue #6109

- Tools
  - [plot_trajectories.py](Tools/Visualization.md#plot_trajectoriespy) can now filter input data by edges (**--filter-edges**) and vehicle-ids (**--filter-ids**). Issue #6952
  - [plot_trajectories.py](Tools/Visualization.md#plot_trajectoriespy) can now visualize person trajectories using option **--persons**. Issue #6978
  - Added new tool [computeCoordination.py](Tools/Output.md#computecoordinationpy) to compute the fraction of delayed vehicles along a defined corridor. Issue #6987
  - implausibleRoutes.py now works better with routes consisting of a single edge only and respects internal edge lengths. It can also detect routes containing edge loops or node loops. Issue #7071
  - osmWebWizard now exports public transport edges for rail vehicles when setting both of the options 'Car-only Network' and 'Import public transport'. Issue #7081
  - [edgeDataFromFlow.py](Tools/Detector.md#edgedatafromflowpy) now supports time intervals. Issue #7133
  - Added new tool [net2geojson](Tools/Net.md#net2geojsonpy) for converting a .net.xml file into GeoJSON format. Issue #7237
  - [attributeStats.py](Tools/Output.md#attributestatspy) now supports option **--precision** to control output precision. Issue #7238
  - Improved [cutRoutes.py](Tools/Routes.md#cutroutespy) for use with person plans. Issue #6027, #7384
  - Added new tool [addStopDelay.py](Tools/Routes.md#addstopdelaypy) to add random stop delays to a route file. Issue #5209
  - [routeSampler.py](Tools/Turns.md#routesampler.py): Now supports option **--weighted**. This causes routes to be sampled according to their probability. The probabilty can either be specified explicitly using route attribute 'probability' or implicitly if the same sequence of edges appears multiple times in the the route input. Issue #7501
    
### Other
- Simulation
  - Route attribute 'period' was renamed to 'cycleTime'. Issue #7168
  - Total simulation running time is now in seconds rather than milliseconds. Issue #7255
- netconvert
  - Roads of type 'highway.track' (aggricultural roads) are no longer accessible by cars when importing OSM data. Issue #7082

- Netedit
  - Demand creation entries have been renamed to better distinguish the different variants (i.e. flow with embedded route or flow with origin and destination). Issue #7175

- TraCI
  - In the python client, function vehicle.getLeader can now optionally return the pair ("", -1) instead of 'None' if no leader is found. The new behavior can be enabled by calling function traci.setLegacyGetLeader(False). In later versions this will be the default behavior. The return value 'None' is deprecated. Issue #7013
  - The function 'libsumo.vehicle.getNextStops' now returns a list of StopData objects rather than a list of tuples (the same result type returned by getStops) but different from the return type of 'traci.vehicle.getNextStops'. If the python script should be fully compatible between traci and libsumo, the new function 'vehicle.getStops' must be used.

- Tools
  - [randomTrips.py](Tools/Trip.md) now generates repeatable results by default (by using a fixed default seed). To obtain the prior random behavior without specifying a seed, the option **--random** can be used (just like for [sumo](sumo.md)). Issue #6989

- Documentation
  - Dark Mode added (not available on Internet Explorer)
  - Added documentation on [length-geometry-mismatch](Simulation/Distances.md)

### Other

- Simulation
  - The default [algorithm for averaging road speed to estimate
    rerouting travel
    times](Demand/Automatic_Routing.md#edge_weights) was
    changed from *exponential average (0.5)* to *moving average
    (180s)*. This is better suited for averaging traffic light
    cycles in urban road networks. To restore the old behavior, the
    option **--device.rerouting.adaptation-weight 0.5** can be used. Issue #4975

- netconvert
  - Turn-arounds are no longer built at geometry-like nodes by
    default (when there is a node but no intersection so there would
    only be straight connections and turn-arounds). The old behavior
    can be restored by setting option **--no-turnarounds.geometry false**. Issue #5121
  - The default priorities for different railway edge types imported
    from OSM haven been changed so that all types use a different
    priority value.
  - The assigned edge speed for unrestricted motorways was lowered
    to 142km/h (from 300km/h) to better reflect real world speed
    distributions (together with the default speed factor
    distribution). Also, the default motorway speed was lowered from
    160km/h to 142km/h for the same reason. Issue #5434

- TraCI
  - TraCI Version is now 20
  - Function *trafficlight.setCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    expectes the 5th component *next* to be a list of integers when
    defining phases. Function
    '*'trafficlight.getCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    returns a list of integers as the 5th component (next) when
    defining phases. Custom clients must be patched to handle this.
  - Function *trafficlight.setCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    accepts *name* as an optional 6th component when defining
    phases. Function
    '*'trafficlight.getCompleteRedYellowGreeenDefinition* now
    returns *name* as the 6th component when defining phases. Custom
    clients must be patched to handle this.
  - TraaS function *Simulation.findRoute* now returns SumoStage
    object (containing all data returned by the TraCI API) instead
    of SumoStringList with just the edge IDs
  - TraaS function *Simulation.findRoute* now returns
    LinkedList<SumoStage\> (containing all data returned by the TraCI
    API) instead of LinkedList<SumoStringList\>

- Documentation
  - Added Tutorial for [Manhattan
    Mobility](Tutorials/Manhattan.md).
  - The [TraaS](TraCI/TraaS.md) library is now documented
    within the wiki.

    lights. A traffic light is guessed if the sum of speeds of all
    incoming lanes exceeds the threshold value. Issue #4681
  - Added new node attribute `rightOfWay` to configure the algorithm for
    computing right-of-way rules (allowed values are *default*,
    *edgePriority*). Also added new option **--default.right-of-way** to set this value for

    be customized separately for each vType using attribute
    *collisionMinGapFactor*. Issue #4529
  - Increased running speed of simulations with *device.rerouting*
    using few vehicles in a large network. Issue #4598

### Other

- Simulation
  - Collision for vehicles controlled by carFollowModel *IDM* are
    only registered when less then half of the minGap distance
    remains between vehicles. This is done to compensate for the
    fact that the model does not guarantee the minGap distance (most
    of the time at least \~90% of the minGap are kept). The
    threshold can be customized via global option and vType
    attributes.

    be a positive floating point number).

    !!! note
        This does not apply to the python tools.
    
  - Added option **--human-readable-time** (short **-H**) that causes all time values to be written
    in h:m:s (or d:h:m:s) format.

- Simulation
  - Tripinfo-output now includes the attribute *stopTime* which
    records the time spent with intentional stopping. Issue #3693

    includes the reason for rerouting. Issue #4204
  - Added optional attribute *visible* to `<parkingAreaReroute` (default *false*). This

    when enabled via gui settings. Issue #3814
  - Now ParkingAreas and ParkingSpaces can be created in netedit. Issue #3104
  - When adding a new phase to a traffic light, the new phase will
    now have a plausible successor state depending on the selected
    previous phase (rather the being a copy). Issue #4041
  - Added function 'split' to junction context menu. This can be
    used to disaggregated joined junctions. Issue #4046
  - When joining traffic lights (by editing junction attribute
    'tl'), link indices of the target traffic light are now
    preserved if signal groups are used (multiple connections with
    the same *linkIndex* value). Issue #4094

    !!! caution
        The the signal states for the edited junction must be checked by the user

  - When defining [double connections](Networks/PlainXML.md#multiple_connections_from_the_same_edge_to_the_same_target_lane), the right-of-way rules now take the road topology into account to differentiate between on-ramp and off-ramp situations. Issue #3834
  - Importing VISUM networks up to format version 10 is now support. Issue #3898
  - Improved heuristics for options **--junctions.join**. Issue #876

  - Added option **--junctions.limit-turn-speed** {{DT_FLOAT}} which sets an upper bound on speed while passing an intersection based on the turning radius. To account for imperfect road geometry, the option **--junctions.limit-turn-speed.min-angle** can be used to avoid speed limits for small turns. Warnings are issued when the difference between road speed and connection speed rises above a configurable threshold (**--junctions.limit-turn-speed.warn.straight, --junctions.limit-turn-speed.warn.turn**). These warnings often indicate exaggerated road speeds on urban roads as well as faulty geometry. Issue #1141

    - The alphanumerical junction naming scheme is active by
      default (the option for enabling the old scheme was renamed
      from **grid.alphanumerical-ids** to **--alphanumerical-ids**).
    - When using alphanumerical junction ids, the intermediate
      string *to* is omitted from edge names because the edge ID
      already allows unambiguous determination of its junctions
      without it
  - Added option **--rand.random-lanenumber** to randomize lane numbers in random networks
    between 1 and *default.lanenumber*
  - Added option **--rand.random-priority** to edge priorities in random networks between 1
    and *default.priority*

    Graphical simulation with libsumo is not yet supported.
  - function *vehicle.add* now supports using the empty string ("")
    as a route id to insert the vehicle on an arbitrary valid edge.
    This makes it easier to remote-control vehicles using moveToXY
    without defining an initial route. Issue #3722
  - added functions *simulation.getCollidingVehiclesNumber* and
    *simulation.getCollidingVehiclesIDList* to track collisions. Issue #3099
  - added functions *simulation.getEmergencyStoppingVehiclesNumber*
    and *simulation.getEmergencyStoppingVehiclesIDList* to track
    emergency stops. Issue #4312
  - added function *edge.getLaneNumber* to retrieve the number of
    lanes of an edge. Issue #3630
  - added function *vehicle.getAcceleration* to retrieve the
    acceleration in the previous step. Issue #4112
  - TraCI now allows to update a vehicle's best lanes
    (vehicle.updateBestLanes). Issue #4146
  - added function *gui.hasView* to determine whether graphical
    capabilities exist. Issue #4014

    persons that are still active in the simulation. Issue #3707
  - added function *traci.getLabel* to the python client to help
    working with multiple connections.
  - When adding a vehicle with a disconnected 2-edge route, it will
    be treated like a `<trip>` and rerouted automatically. Issue #4307
  - added functions *vehicle.getRoutingMode* and
    *vehicle.setRoutingMode*. When setting routing mode to
    *traci.constants.ROUTING_MODE_AGGREGATED*, [smoothed travel
    times](Demand/Automatic_Routing.md#edge_weights) are
    used instead of current travel times. Issue #3383

- Tools
  - added script
    [plot_trajectories.py](Tools/Visualization.md#plot_trajectoriespy)
    which allows plotting various combinations of time, distance,
    speed and acceleration for all trajectories in a given **--fcd-output** file.
  - added script
    [averageRuns.py](Tools/Misc.md#averagerunspy) for
    running a scenario multiple times with different random seeds

  - Added [documentation on joined traffic lights and defining
    signal groups](Simulation/Traffic_Lights.md).
  - Added [documentation on the simple continous lane-change
    model](Simulation/SublaneModel.md#simple_continous_lane-change_model).
  - Documented all supported [routing
    algorithms](Simulation/Routing.md#routing_algorithms).

- Simulation
  - `<vTypeProbe>` is now deprecated in favour of FCD-output filtering
  - `<vaporizer>` is now deprecated in favour of calibrators.
  - The default arrival position for person walks is now the middle
    of the destination edge. This reduces the assymetry from
    arriving in forward or backward direction. Issue #3843
  - tripinfo-output attribute *waitSteps* which counts the number of
    simulation steps in which the vehicle was below a threshold
    speed of 0.1m/s was replaced by attribute *waitingTime* which
    measures the same time in seconds. This gives results which are
    independent of the **--step-length** simulation parameter. Issue #3749
  - The default value for option **--device.rerouting.pre-period** was changed from *1* to *60* to
    speed up simulation. Issue #3865
  - The default speed deviation has been changed to *0.1*. When
    defining a new `<vType>` with attribute *vClass*, this also influences
    the default speed deviation:
    - *truck*, *trailer*, *coach*, *delivery*: 0.05
    - *tram*, *rail*, *rail_electric*, *rail_urban*,
      *emergency*: 0
    - everything else 0.1

!!! note
    The previous behavior can be restored by setting option **--default.speeddev 0**

- sumo-gui
  - Default color for persons is now 'blue' to better distinguish
    them from vehicles.

- netconvert
  - There is no longer an offset of 0.1m between lanes. This means
    the total visual width of an edge is now the sum of all lane
    widths. This also fixes an inconsistency between visualization
    and simulation as the vehicles always ignored this offset
    anyway. Road markings are now drawn on top of the lanes rather
    than between them. This causes small visual gaps in old networks
    (fixable by calling *netconvert -s old.net.xml -o new.net.xml*). Issue #3972
  - The default value for option **--default.junctions.radius** was increased from 1.5 to 4 in
    order to improve realism of turning angles.
  - The default value for option **--default.junctions.corner-detail** was increased from 0 to 5 to
    improve the visual realism of larger intersections.
  - Option **--ramps.guess** is now enabled by default
  - Vehicle speed while turning at intersections is now limited via
    the new option default **--limit-turn-speed 5.5**. To obtain the old behavior, this value
    can be set to -1.

- TraCI
  - TraCI Version is now 18
  - Embeded python is now deprecated in favour of
    [Libsumo](Libsumo.md).
  - TraCI now consistently represents time in seconds as a double
    precision floating point. This affects all client
    implementations. For convenience the affected python calls are
    listed below. Modifying your scripts should be necessary only
    for the methods printed in **bold**:
    - **traci.simulationStep**
    - traci.edge.getTravelTime
    - traci.edge.getEffort
    - traci.edge.adaptTravelTime
    - traci.edge.setEffort
    - traci.person.add
    - traci.vehicle.getAdaptedTravelTime
    - traci.vehicle.getEffort
    - traci.vehicle.adaptTravelTime
    - traci.vehicle.setEffort
    - **traci.vehicle.slowDown**
    - **traci.vehicle.changeLane**
    - **traci.vehicle.setStop**
    - traci.simulation.getCurrentTime still returns ms as int but
      has been deprecated in favor of traci.simulation.getTime
    - traci.simulation.findRoute
    - traci.simulation.findIntermodalRoute
    - **traci.simulation.getDeltaT**
    - **traci.trafficlight.getNextSwitch**
    - **traci.trafficlight.getPhaseDuration**
    - traci.trafficlight.getCompleteRedYellowGreenDefinition
    - **traci.trafficlight.setPhaseDuration**
    - traci.trafficlight.setCompleteRedYellowGreenDefinition
  - The TraCI boundary type has been replaced by a position list of
    2 positions
  - The TraCI float type has been removed
  - All protocol functions returning single bytes now return
    integers (lane.getLinkNumber, polygon.getFilled,
    vehicle.isRouteValid, vehicle.getStopState)
  - In the C++ client the function vehicle.getEdges was renamed to
    getRoute to be consistent with other clients
  - The order of error checks in the TraCI server changed so that
    unknown object errors show up before unknown variable / command
    errors
  - The python client
    - the function vehicle.add was replaced by the function
      addFull. The old "add" is still present and can be
      reactivated by monkey patching the module
      (traci.vehicle.add=traci.vehicle.addLegacy)
    - constants which were previously available in the single
      domains have moved to traci.constants
    - now returns tuples instead of lists for all getIDList and
      several other calls
    - the function *getSubscriptionResults* now requires the ID of
      the subscribed object as argument. To retrieve all results
      in a map, the function *getAllSubscriptionResults* can be
      used
